# The Simplest Solution for Business : Conversation

Most human activities start with conversations between people. However, as technology advances, machines and computers have entered the space between people, making the use of both conversation and technology essential in human activities.

Today’s businesses still require a great deal of conversation and technology. Externally, they need to communicate in ways that suit various types of customers, and internally, they must handle tasks that align with customer needs and challenges. In this process, the communication chain connecting customers, companies, and employees consumes significant resources before the actual problem reaches a solver and the appropriate technology is applied.

In the world of business, where results must be achieved within limited resources and time, such communication is vast yet crucial and cannot be overlooked.

However, if business operations became as simple as conversations and were automated to assist people where needed, we could focus on what truly matters—gaining insights that drive business outcomes. AI makes this transformation possible.

# Conversations to Tasks with AI

Recent AI technology is fundamentally changing how humans and machines interact. AI now provides an environment where it can understand and respond to human language and enable software to process tasks through reasoning.

Beyond meeting customers to introduce or sell products, even tasks such as requesting complex operations from servers and analyzing data to make business decisions can be transformed into simple and intuitive experiences through conversations with AI agents.

In particular, AI agents shine when judgment and adaptation to the situation are required. As the number of possible scenarios increases, traditional software or manuals often require complex manipulations. However, AI agents can understand each individual situation through conversation and make judgments based on pre-established guidelines.

Just as VIP customers require special treatment, businesses can implement experiences that solve unique problems for both external users and internal stakeholders through conversation. A company’s final decision-makers will be able to execute their instructions through AI agents instead of directly manipulating complex systems, and then monitor the results.

This is the ultimate experience we envision: an environment where conversation directly engages customers to handle tasks, streamlines internal operations, and ultimately creates greater business performance. Wrtn Labs is building systems to realize this vision.

# Your Problem, Your Unique Agent

The wide array of challenges in business requires equally diverse tools and approaches. This is why organizations rely on collaboration among experts from different fields.

Similarly, the appropriate optimization for AI agents varies for each business problem, large and small. Since a single business can have a variety of problem scenarios, what’s important is a easy-to-use and scalable environment for the rapid creation and testing of AI agents tailored to each situation.

We aim to build a platform with the following features to support the creation and application of such AI agents:

1. Empower field experts to embed their operational guidelines and know-how into background prompts.

2. Enable the selection and connection of solutions used in daily operations as tools for the agents.

3. Provide visibility into how connected data and functions align with the specific problems and needs of the field.

4. Allow for feedback and verification of improvements.

5. Manage and monitor problem resolution and outcomes through the deployment of AI agents.

The tools needed to build these agents can be created, shared, and contributed to by builders, enabling popular services to be integrated as tools for AI agents or allowing companies to offer their own services to agents. By sharing tools within a common infrastructure, we aim to create Open Labs as a community where everyone can build, validate, and utilize the most suitable AI agents for their specific problem scenarios.

Wrtn Labs envisions an AI ecosystem where everyone can thrive together.

Thank you.
