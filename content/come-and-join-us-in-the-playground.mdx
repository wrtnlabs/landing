# 1. Intuitive Connector Combinations

Wrtn Labs offers pre-built connectors as examples for AI agent builders. With a simple UI, users can combine a few connectors to test business-ready scenarios with just a few clicks. The available connector documentation provides users with detailed information, including the features of each connector, parameters, and potential use cases. By understanding the functionality of each connector, users can strategically integrate them into AI agent workflows to realize the synergistic potential for automation and problem-solving.

# 2. AI Agent Conversations and Tasks

Through conversations with the generated agents, users can execute the functions of connected services. Users can test example prompts for combined services or input their own scenarios to quickly check real-world speed and performance. You can also analyze token usage to consider the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the agent that will be introduced into your business.

\* Each account can experience up to 30 free interactions. Beyond this limit, users can connect their own LLM API keys in the settings for unlimited access.

# 3. Verification of Applicability

Successfully functioning agents can be exported as chatbot widgets or utilized in API form. We plan to provide tools that allow you to easily integrate these generated and validated AI agents into your existing workflows and applications. For example, you can embed the agent as an interactive chatbot on your website to enhance customer support, or utilize its API capabilities to automate internal processes and improve productivity. We will also include options for managing and monitoring deployed agents.

\* These features will be reflected in future product releases. Currently, Playground offers a simple blueprint for this.

The Wrtn Labs platform goes beyond simply providing AI technologyâ€”it supports every step required to solve unique business problems. Imagine AI agents and tools tailored to your services and challenges, and experience their potential firsthand in Playground. Share your feedback or needs with our team, and we will actively consider them for future product releases.
